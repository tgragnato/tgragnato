> You don't hire for skills, you hire for attitude. You can always teach skills. "Simon Sinek"

The atmosphere in Berlin was perfect: interesting rooms, interesting things, awesome people. Some talks were badly matched to the stages.

Fast delivery is one of the most demanded things in the software industry, making testing and processes become even more important

AI content was overwhelming and the content was in most cases light or boring. The stocks of AI companies might be a game changer or a bubble.

## My Event

Having the option to ***choose which talks to attend at a conference*** from a vast selection is preferable for several reasons. It allows participants to select sessions that align with their personal interests and professional needs, providing a more engaging and tailored experience. This flexibility also lets attendees pick talks that match their level of knowledge, avoiding sessions that may be too basic or too advanced, and thus optimizing their learning.

Additionally, choosing freely from a variety of topics broadens one's exposure to different subjects, enhancing understanding and expertise. It also enables better time management, as attendees can skip sessions that do not interest them and use the time for networking or other activities. Moreover, attending sessions of common interest facilitates targeted networking with others who share similar passions or professional goals, leading to more meaningful collaborative opportunities.

## A retrospective on the state of DevOps and Infrastructure Engineering in Italy compared to the rest of the world

The goal of platform engineering is to **reduce operational complexity** and allow developers to focus on writing code, minimizing the time and effort required to manage infrastructure and deployment processes.

With reference to `Team Topologies`, the platform group is responsible for creating and maintaining the platforms used by all other teams (_Stream-aligned_, _Enabling_, and _Complicated subsystem_).

All of this hinges on the premise of a robust infrastructure foundation. [The renowned figure David Heinemeier Hansson](https://dhh.dk) raises the topic of `escaping the cloud`, but he doesn't address how to reconcile the lack of expertise in managing performances by infrastructure engineers with the prerequisites and needs for horizontal scalability and rapid deployment.

I agree that 99% of developers will likely never need to deal with these issues, but for those in the 1%, there's no clear alternative to the cloud. (please find me one, `self-hosting` will then be the best bang for the buck)

***Italy is behind and extremely lacking in hard skills.***
